Developed with Xtext from Open Architecture Ware (OAW).

As Xtext seems not to be the perfect solution for this special case, it is more like a case study then a working plugin.

It is recommended to use the netbeans module/plugin with netbeans.

If anyone is interested to improve and deploy this plugin, feel free to contact me.

Currently I search for a more suitable solution then Xtext to create an eclipse plugin.
